This program uses Pyroomacoustics to simulate a box room. You can have two sound sources read from a stereo wav file (I will attach for info) and then the output can be saved to a stereo wav file.

It will draw the plan of the room and where the sound sources are and the two microphones from which the program simulates the output.
You can change the reverberation and room dimensions of course.The absorbtion coefficient if set to zero is like an echo chamber and when 1 it is anechoic.
